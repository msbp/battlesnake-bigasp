There once was a fish who loved to swim
This little guy's life was always dim
He wasn't too smart but everyone knew
What mola mola's could wholeheartedly do
With the size of an elephant and the strength of a lion
Frank was a mad lad who resembled Goliath
With the world cup looming and everything blooming
He could hardly contain his excitement for the game
Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, and France
All playing for glory, thankful for their chance
Lionel Messi, the greatest of many
Will display his talents in the country of Putin
Excuse me while I get some more food
This food really doesn't fill too much
But it is better than nothing
Moving on with the story now
So frank moved from the underwater country
To the city looking for a job, some sort of income
He started working at the Krusty Krab restaurant
Then quickly moved on to be a police officer of the deep started
Frank gave up being a police officer to become a lifegaurd
A stressfree job where all that was required of him
Was to watch fish swim, something fish were born knowing how to do
One day while on duty, he was feeling useless, 
And rightfully so, as his job was pointless,
When an elderly looking fish walked up to him and said
You remind me of a young fish that I once knew...
